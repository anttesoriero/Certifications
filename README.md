# Certification Repository
###### Updated 24 March 2025
To further my professional development and technical knowledge, I've decided to compelete some courses and certifications in my free time. This repo will store any code from my courses that I've done, as long as it's not stored inside the course itself (such as IBM Cloud in some assignments). It's also a place I can track what I'm up to outside of Coursera.

Completion certificates are linked next to each completed course, on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anttesoriero/details/certifications/), or [Credly](https://credly.com/users/anttesoriero)
