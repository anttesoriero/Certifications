# IBM Certification Repository
###### Updated 26 May 2024
To further my professional development and technical knowledge, I've decided to compelete some courses and certifications in my free time. This repo will store any code from my courses that I've done, as long as it's not stored in IBM Cloud (depends on the assignment). It's also a place I can track what I'm up to outside of Coursera.

Completion certificates are linked next to each completed course, on my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anttesoriero/details/certifications/), or [Credly](https://credly.com/users/anttesoriero)
